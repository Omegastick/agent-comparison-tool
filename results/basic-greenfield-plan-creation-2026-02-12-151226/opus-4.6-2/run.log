I'll start by understanding what the `/speckit.plan` command does. Let me first explore the codebase to understand the project structure and find any relevant speckit configuration.

Now let me read the key files I need to execute the `/speckit.plan` command:

[0m→ [0mRead .specify/memory/constitution.md
[0m→ [0mRead .specify/scripts/bash/common.sh
Now I have a complete understanding of the project. Let me create the plan. I need to:

1. Switch to the `001-todo-crud` branch
2. Run the setup-plan.sh script to copy the template
3. Fill in the plan template with concrete details based on the spec and constitution
4. Create supporting artifacts (research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/)

The script placed the plan at `/workspace/repo/specs/001-todo-crud/plan.md`. Note this is `specs/` at the repo root, while the spec itself is at `.specify/specs/001-todo-crud/spec.md`. Let me verify:

### Key Decisions
- **Stack**: Python 3.11+ / FastAPI / SQLite (stdlib `sqlite3`) / Pydantic v2 / pytest + httpx / uv
- **No ORM**: Direct parameterized SQL queries (Simplicity First principle)
- **Constitution**: All 5 principles pass; no violations to track
- **Project layout**: Single-project structure with `src/` and `tests/` (contract/integration/unit)
- **Validation**: FastAPI's 422 remapped to 400 per spec; UUID format validated in path params

The commit is local -- run `git push` when ready to publish.
