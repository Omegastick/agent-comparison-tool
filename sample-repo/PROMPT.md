# Task

Generate a detailed implementation plan for the User Notification System described in `SPEC.md`.

## Instructions

1. Read and understand the `CONSTITUTION.md` file - your plan must follow all principles and constraints defined there.

2. Read and understand the `SPEC.md` file - your plan must address all requirements.

3. Create a comprehensive implementation plan that includes:

   - **Architecture Overview**: High-level design of the notification system
   - **Module Structure**: How the code will be organized
   - **Data Models**: Pydantic models for all entities
   - **Implementation Phases**: Break down into logical phases
   - **Task List**: Specific, actionable tasks with clear acceptance criteria
   - **Testing Strategy**: How each component will be tested
   - **Risk Assessment**: Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

4. The plan should be:
   - Detailed enough for a developer to implement without additional clarification
   - Following all constraints from the constitution
   - Addressing all requirements from the spec
   - Including estimates for each phase (in relative complexity, not time)

## Output

Write your plan to a file called `PLAN.md` in this repository.
